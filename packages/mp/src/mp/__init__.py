"""Main entry point for the `mp` CLI tool.

This script initializes and runs the Typer application, exposing various
commands for building, checking, configuring, and formatting integration
projects within the marketplace. It imports the sub-applications from
the `build_project`, `check`, `config`, and `format` modules and mounts
them onto the main Typer instance.
