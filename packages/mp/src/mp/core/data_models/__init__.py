"""Data models representing integration components.

This package defines a set of data classes that model various aspects of
an integration, such as actions, connectors, jobs, widgets, release notes,
custom families, mapping rules, and the integration itself. These data
models provide functionality to instantiate themselves from both the
"built" (final, deployable) and "non-built" (source) representations found
within the marketplace. They also offer methods to convert back and forth
between these formats, facilitating the build and deconstruction processes.
