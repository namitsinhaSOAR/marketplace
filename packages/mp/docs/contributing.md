- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Update the README.md or documentation with details of changes to the interface, if applicable
- Update the tests to cover your changes
- Ensure the test suite passes
- Ensure your code passes static type checking and linting
- Keep the PR as focused as possible, if you have multiple features, submit multiple PRs

## Code Style

This project uses:

- [Ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff) for linting and formatting
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/) for static type checking

Before submitting your code, run:

```bash
mp format
mp check --static-type-check
